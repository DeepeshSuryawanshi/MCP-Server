# Module Protocol Server - Learning Project

This project is a personal learning initiative focused on understanding and implementing a **Module Protocol Server**. It covers the basics of protocol design, client-server communication, and modular server architecture.

## 📚 Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Learn how a protocol server works
- Understand client-server communication over a network
- Explore modular programming concepts
- Experiment with building a simple protocol from scratch

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Programming Language: C / C++ (or specify your language)
- Networking: Socket Programming
- OS: Linux/Windows (specify which one you're using)
- Tools: GCC, GDB, Wireshark (optional), etc.

## 🚀 Features

- Modular architecture for handling different protocols
- Simple client-server communication
- Logging and debugging features
- Extendable design for future protocols

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Basics of network protocols
- How to write a server that handles different modules/protocols
- How data is structured and transmitted over sockets
- Error handling and debugging techniques in network programming
